# TETRIS

In a previous project I had made tetris which you can play here:
https://github.com/TobleroneBill/TETRIS
https://billiams.itch.io/pytris

This project took me ahwile, used 0 tutorials and was complete + worked well, but had many areas of improvement.

This Project aims to refine the game, and with some design goals in mind while make the actual engine a lot better than a single big class file.

### Project Goals

At minimum I will have:
 - Tetris, with the various improvements from last build
 - A Menu screen
 - Nice art, sound and some minor particles
 - Stat recording
 - Generic options menu

### Stretch goals

The things I hope to add once these major pieces are in place, are what I think of as stretch goals. 

These are:

- Multiple Game Modes
  - Survival
  - Puzzle
- Basic progression systems
- Multiplayer

# Misc

I will probably add more the lists above, and development is streamed every day on my youtube channel:

When finished, or at some milestones I will be making videos about it too which will be up on that channel

I think in pretty much any aspect of this, any help (of any level) is appreciated (¬‿¬)
