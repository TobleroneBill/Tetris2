#/_______________________________________________/DEFAULT GAME MODE/_______________________________________________/

# GOALS:
#   - Need a resizable window that scales

#   - All things have to mutate a single board - No making new ones (unless you are screwed)
#       - We need to be able to set the board state on load for custom boards (testing atm)
#           - Do need a puzzle board, but could be a modification of this as long as its solid as rocks

#   - Tetris pieces 1-7 + 1x1 blocks (for testing)
#       - Make test rooms for checking specific scenarios
#           - Side collisions
#           - Block collisions
#           - Wierd Tspin stuff
#           - Any other odd things (make a more detailed list somewhere)

#   - Need better input handling than last time
#       - Think I was trying to amalgam mutliple different styles of input from my own ideas and actual tetris
#       - Make a design Doc for this

#   - A system of showing Active pieces with any possible color

#   - Graphics
#       - CLEAR ART STYLE
#       - Good Tetris pieces
#       - Particles on line clears
